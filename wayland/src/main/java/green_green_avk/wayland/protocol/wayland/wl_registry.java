/**
 * global registry object
 * <p>
 * The singleton global registry object. The server has a number of
 * global objects that are available to all clients. These objects
 * typically represent an actual object in the server (for example,
 * an input device) or they are singleton objects that provide
 * extension functionality.
 * <p>
 * When a client creates a registry object, the registry object
 * will emit a global event for each global currently in the
 * registry. Globals come and go as a result of device or
 * monitor hotplugs, reconfiguration or other events, and the
 * registry will send out global and {@code global_remove} events to
 * keep the client up to date with the changes. To mark the end
 * of the initial burst of events, the client can use the
 * {@code wl_display.sync} request immediately after calling
 * {@code wl_display.get_registry}.
 * <p>
 * A client can bind to a global object by using the bind
 * request. This creates a client-side handle that lets the object
 * emit events to the client and lets the client invoke requests on
 * the object.
